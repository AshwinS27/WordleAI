# WordleAI
Repository for EECS 592 Project for making AI solver for Wordle and its variants.

There are three different Python files to run the code:
1. `main.py`: This runs the vanilla Wordle solver
2. `octordle.py`: This runs the Octordle solver
3. `two_player.py`: This pits two Wordle solvers against each other.

All three files use the `State` class to keep track of board & for making the guesses.
